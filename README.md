# ‚öõÔ∏è Cross-Platform Monorepo Boilerplate üöÄ

This is a production-ready boilerplate for building full-stack, offline-first applications with a shared codebase. It's designed for projects that need a web presence, mobile access via a Progressive Web App (PWA), and a powerful desktop application with offline capabilities, all supported by a robust backend API.

The core philosophy is to maximize code reuse through a `pnpm` workspace, shared UI components, and common type definitions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-   **Node.js**: `v22.x` or higher is required.
-   **pnpm**: This monorepo is managed with `pnpm`. If you don't have it, install it globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g pnpm
    ```
-   **Docker**: Docker Desktop must be installed and running to manage the local PostgreSQL database.

## ‚ú® Core Features

-   üîó **Unified Monorepo:** A single `pnpm` workspace to manage all your applications and shared packages.
-   üíª **Cross-Platform UI:** Write your components once with the shared `ui-components` package. They automatically render as optimized Next.js components on the web and as standard elements in the Electron app.
-   üåê **Web & Mobile (PWA):** A Next.js application built with the App Router, ready to be deployed as a Progressive Web App for a native-like mobile experience.
-   üîå **Offline-First Desktop App:** The Electron and Vite setup is pre-configured with a separate SQLite database via Prisma, allowing your desktop application to work completely offline.
-   ‚òÅÔ∏è **Scalable Backend:** A powerful and extensible NestJS API to serve all your clients.
-   üîí **Type-Safe Database Layer:** End-to-end type safety with Prisma, configured for both PostgreSQL (server) and SQLite (desktop).
-   üê≥ **Local Development Ready:** Includes a `docker-compose.yml` file to instantly spin up a local PostgreSQL database.

## üèÅ Getting Started: Setting Up a New Project

Follow these steps to configure this boilerplate for your new project.

### Step 1: Create the Project from the Template

The best way is to use this repository as a GitHub Template.

1.  Click the **"Use this template"** button on the [repository page](https://github.com/xxwawexx/cross-platform-monorepo).
2.  Give your new repository a name (e.g., `my-new-app`).
3.  Clone your new repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-new-app.git
    cd my-new-app
    ```

### Step 2: Configure Your Project Name ‚úèÔ∏è

You will need to replace `[project-name]` in several key files and directories. **`[project-name]`** should be a short, lowercase, URL-friendly name (e.g., `evently`, `medflow`, `tracker-app`).

**A. Rename Directories**

In the `apps/` directory, rename the project-specific folders:
1.  Rename `apps/[project-name]-api`
2.  Rename `apps/[project-name]-desktop`
3.  Rename `apps/[project-name]-next`

**B. Update Configuration Files**

Use your code editor's "Find and Replace in Files" feature for the following changes. **Search for `[project-name]` and replace it with your actual project name.**

-   **`package.json`** (in the root directory)
    -   Update the `"name"` field.
-   **`docker-compose.yml`**
    -   Update `container_name: [project-name]-db`.
    -   Update `POSTGRES_DB: [project-name]_db`.
-   **`apps/[project-name]-api/package.json`**
    -   Update the `"name"` field.
-   **`apps/[project-name]-desktop/package.json`**
    -   Update the `"name"` field.
-   **`apps/[project-name]-next/package.json`**
    -   Update the `"name"` field.
-   **`apps/[project-name]-desktop/electron.cjs`**
    -   Update any paths or window titles that may contain the project name.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies üì¶

After renaming, you must run a fresh install. A single `pnpm install` command from the root will read all `package.json` files, install all dependencies for all apps and packages, and correctly link everything in the workspace.

```bash
# Run from the project root
pnpm install
```

### Step 4: Set Up Local Environment üóÑÔ∏è

1.  **Configure Environment Variables for the API:**
    -   Navigate to the API directory: `cd apps/[project-name]-api`.
    -   Create a new `.env` file by copying the example: `cp .env.example .env`.
    -   Open the new `.env` file and ensure the `DATABASE_URL` matches your PostgreSQL setup from `docker-compose.yml`. It should look like this:
        ```env
        DATABASE_URL="postgresql://admin:admin@localhost:5432/[project-name]_db?schema=public"
        ```
    -   **Important:** Replace `[project-name]_db` with the actual database name you set in `docker-compose.yml`.

2.  **Start the Database with Docker:**
    -   Make sure Docker Desktop is running.
    -   From the project root, start the PostgreSQL container:
        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d
        ```

3.  **Run Initial Database Migration:**
    -   The `migrate:dev` command is a convenient script that runs two migrations in sequence: one for the PostgreSQL database (for the web) and one for the SQLite database (for the offline desktop app).
        ```bash
        # Make sure to replace `[project-name]-api` with your actual API package name
        pnpm --filter [project-name]-api migrate:dev
        ```
    -   **Important:** You will be prompted to enter a migration name **twice**. It is safe to use the same name (e.g., `init`) for both prompts.

    -   **For more granular control**, you can also run each migration individually:
        -   To migrate only the PostgreSQL database:
            ```bash
            pnpm --filter [project-name]-api migrate:dev:postgres
            ```
        -   To migrate only the SQLite database:
            ```bash
            pnpm --filter [project-name]-api migrate:dev:sqlite
            ```

        #### Handling Database Drift ‚ö†Ô∏è

        If you make manual changes to the database or your migration history gets out of sync, Prisma may detect a "drift" and prevent new migrations. To resolve this in your local development environment, you can reset the database.

        **Warning:** This command will permanently delete all data in your local Docker database and re-apply all migrations.

        ```bash
        pnpm --filter [project-name]-api migrate reset
        ```         
        
4.  **Build the API (One-Time Setup for Desktop)**
    -   The Electron desktop application depends on the build artifacts (compiled JavaScript and type definitions) from the NestJS API. Before you can run the desktop app for the first time, you need to build the API at least once.
        ```bash
        pnpm --filter [project-name]-api build
        ```
    -   *Note: The NestJS development server (`start:dev`) also builds the project, so this step is mainly for the initial setup or if you need to update shared types for the desktop app without running the full API server.*

### Step 5: Run the Development Servers ‚ö°

You can run all applications at once or start them individually.

#### Run All Services Concurrently

This is the easiest way to get started. It will start the web app, desktop app, and the backend API at the same time.

```bash
# Run from the project root
pnpm dev
```

#### Running Applications Individually

If you only need to work on one part of the stack, you can run each application separately to save system resources. Use the `pnpm --filter` command.

-   **To start only the Next.js web app:**
    ```bash
    pnpm --filter [project-name]-next dev
    ```

-   **To start only the Electron desktop app:**
    ```bash
    pnpm --filter [project-name]-desktop dev
    ```

-   **To start only the NestJS API (in watch mode):**
    ```bash
    pnpm --filter [project-name]-api start:dev
    ```

Your new project is fully set up and ready for development!
